<p class="p0"><span class="dropcap">N</span>O PROBLEM confronting the beekeeper in most parts of the
United States is of more importance than the proper wintering
of bees, yet it is one which is sadly neglected. It is urged that before
attempting to make packing cases for the wintering of bees the beekeeper
study Department Bulletin 93, Temperature of the Honeybee
Cluster in Winter, and Farmers' Bulletin 695, Outdoor Wintering of
Bees.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="THE_ESSENTIALS_TO_SUCCESS" id="THE_ESSENTIALS_TO_SUCCESS">THE ESSENTIALS TO SUCCESS.</a></h2>


<p>The essentials to success in caring for a normal colony of bees
from the end of one season's honey-flow to the beginning of the next
lie in providing three things in abundance: (1) Stores of good
quality, (2) protection from wind and cold, and (3) room for the
rearing of brood at appropriate times. These factors are all of the
greatest importance, and an omission of any one of them may prevent
completely the gathering of the honey crop of the following year,
and if any of the factors are given in less degree the honey crop
invariably is reduced. The importance of these essentials does not
apply equally at all times from the end of one season to the beginning
of the next, but at some time they are all vitally essential; and
it is the purpose of this bulletin to show how all three may be given
in the early fall, so that, without further handling, the colonies will
come through the spring with the maximum population. If, for example,
the room for breeding is not provided in the fall, it becomes
necessary to handle the colony early in the spring, and this may be
detrimental. Similarly, it is the practice of some beekeepers to add to
the stores of the colony in the spring, rather than to leave enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"> 4 </a></span>
in the fall to last until new honey comes in. This is dangerous for
two reasons: Too often the stores are not given on time or in adequate
quantity, and frequently they can not be given without exposing
the colony too greatly. It is therefore the best practice by far to
provide all of these factors in the fall, and no other methods are so
safe and certain of success. By practicing the methods here given
the enormous annual loss of colonies in winter may be almost entirely
eliminated, and, what is more important, much stronger colonies may
be obtained for the early sources of honey.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a id="NECESSITY_FOR_STRONG_COLONIES"></a>NECESSITY FOR STRONG COLONIES IN THE FALL.</h2>

<p>A common cause of loss is through attempting to winter colonies
that are too small. It is somewhat difficult to set a standard for
colony strength at this season, but in general it may be stated that it
is unwise to attempt to winter colonies that are not strong enough
to have brood sufficient to fill three to four Langstroth frames two
months before the packing is applied. If the colonies in the apiary
are not of the proper strength it is wise to unite until the proper
strength is reached. Any uniting should be done at least two weeks
before packing. There is a tendency in some localities for colonies
to weaken rapidly in early fall, due to the nature of the honey-flow
from fall flowers. To some degree this may be offset by putting on
the packing earlier than otherwise would be necessary.</p>

<p>It is highly important that each colony have a vigorous queen
in order that brood-rearing may continue in the fall and may proceed
rapidly in the spring. With colonies such as are obtained by
the methods here described it is not desirable to keep queens more
than two years and it is preferable to requeen the entire apiary every
season. To get the best results in requeening all young queens should
be introduced so that they will begin laying two months before packing.
It will be found that queens wear out more rapidly in the
unusually strong colonies obtained by the methods of wintering here
described, but every good beekeeper realizes that it is these enormous
colonies which get the greatest crops.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a id="ARRANGEMENT_OF_THE_APIARY"></a>ARRANGEMENT OF THE APIARY.</h2>

<h3>WIND PROTECTION.</h3>

<p>It is of the greatest importance that the apiary be located where
the wind in winter is virtually eliminated. A grove of trees or an
adjacent hill usually offers the best protection, or it is possible to
make an artificial windbreak such as a high fence. A natural windbreak
usually is better, for it is more extensive in most cases. It
has been found by the authors that if a wind of 20 miles an hour
blows on the winter packing cases for a few hours the temperature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"> 5 </a></span>
of the inside of the packed hive may be greatly reduced and may
even fall as low as that of an unpacked hive. Too much reliance
should not be placed in buildings as windbreaks, for they often serve
simply to divert the wind slightly and may even make conditions
worse. A fence made of close boards usually is unsatisfactory for
it causes whirls that may destroy many colonies. A heavy blanket
of snow serves to reduce the effect of the wind.</p>

four. This arrangement is advantageous whether or not
the bees are wintered in four-colony packing cases.</div>
</div>


<h3>ARRANGEMENT OF THE HIVES.</h3>

<p>In arranging the hives in an apiary it is necessary to take into
account the method of wintering to be followed. If the bees are to
be wintered in the four-colony cases to be described later the hives
should be kept in groups of four all the season (<a href="#fig_1">fig. 1</a>), for if colonies
are moved more than a foot just before packing and then moved
again as they are unpacked there is a considerable amount of "drifting"&mdash;that
is, bees from some colonies join other colonies during
flight, and the result is an actual reduction of the number of colonies
and of bees in the apiary. A failure to keep the colonies properly
arranged for their winter stands during the entire summer is a
common cause of failure in using the four-colony cases. Whatever
type of case is used for outdoor wintering, the bees should occupy
the same place during the entire year.</p>

<p>Since the outside of the winter case is quite different an appearance
from the hives the bees often are somewhat confused. To prevent
drifting from this cause it is a good plan to set a large stake between
the two entrances on each end of the four-colony winter cases; this
will serve to help the bees in orienting themselves during flights in
winter and especially in spring. If it is possible to plant some shrubbery
among the hives it is a good plan to have the plants arranged
so that they will act as markers for the bees during these early flights
(<a href="#fig_3">fig. 3</a>). They will not be amiss during the summer, and, if properly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"> 6 </a></span>
placed, they need not interfere with movement through the apiary
during the summer's work, while they add to its attractiveness.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="INSULATION_OF_THE_HIVE" id="INSULATION_OF_THE_HIVE">INSULATION OF THE HIVE.</a></h2>


<h3>AMOUNT OF PACKING NEEDED.</h3>

<p>It is impossible to insulate bees too heavily during the winter.
It is obvious, however, that the beekeeper will not want to put
on more packing than is practically necessary. For a climate such
as that of Washington, D. C., it is found desirable to provide 4
inches of packing underneath the hives, 6 inches on all sides, and 8 or
more inches on top. In warmer climates less will be needed, but the
beekeeper must not think that simply because he lives south of Washington
he can be safe with less packing or none at all. There are
many places farther south than Washington where more packing is
needed, and there are, indeed, few places except along the Gulf or in
southern California where less may be used if the best results are
to be obtained.</p>

<p>For more northern localities more protection is needed. The
amount indicated for Washington has been used with success in
places as cold as northern Ohio and even in Canada, but in these
places the insulation during the coldest seasons is usually augmented
by heavy snows. These are not at hand every winter, or may be
lacking during the coldest part of the winter, and it is, therefore,
wise to provide more packing, especially on the sides and top. For a
climate such as that of New York or Wisconsin, 8 inches of good
packing on the sides and 1 foot on the top probably will be enough
for good wintering every year. The amounts recommended for the
different zones of the United States are given in Table I (<a href="#Page_15">p. 15</a>).</p>

<p>A belief is current among many amateur beekeepers that good results
may be obtained by using hives which have 2 inches of packing
built in the sides and somewhat more on top. This amount is
insufficient in winter in all parts of the country except the southern
portions of the Gulf States. A common practice is to wrap some
straw or corn fodder around the hives, but this may do more harm
than good if the wind can blow directly through it. A covering of
roofing paper with perhaps a little paper packing underneath is
practically worthless in insulating value.</p>


<h3>TYPES OF PACKING MATERIAL.</h3>

<p>There is little difference in the insulating value of the various
materials which may be obtained easily for the packing of hives
in winter. Exaggerated claims have been made by some beekeepers
for such materials as broken cork or certain commercial insulating
materials, but it is safe to say that there is not 25 per cent difference
between the poorest and the best of the available insulating materials,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"> 7 </a></span>
provided, of course, that obviously poor things such as corn
fodder and straw be eliminated. Sawdust, fine planer shavings,
forest leaves, chaff, broken cork, and such materials may be used, the
choice depending chiefly on the availability of the materials. In
general it may be stated that the smaller and the more numerous the
dead air spaces confined in the packing, the greater will be its efficiency
in insulation. If forest leaves are used they must be gathered
the year before and stored, as the leaves fall some time after the
bees should be packed. If sawdust is used it is best not to pack it
down tight, but if forest leaves or planer shavings are employed it is
essential that they be packed in closely and that the containers be
completely filled. Broken cork, such as is used in the shipping of
certain types of grapes, is good and has the advantage that it does not
hold moisture as does sawdust. In all cases the packing should be
placed in some sort of box which will be rain-proof and thus protect
the insulation from rains and snow, for all insulating materials lose
part of their efficiency when wet.</p>


<h3>BOTTOM PACKING.</h3>

<p>There has been considerable discussion among beekeepers as to the
value of placing packing material below the bottom boards of the hives.
This is usually provided by placing the hives on 2 by 4 inch supports
or on racks of 4-inch material. Those who have opposed this have
pointed out that "heat rises," overlooking the fact that while warm
air attempts to rise, if this is impossible other avenues of escape of
warm-air currents may be set up. Furthermore, and more important,
they have overlooked the important fact that heat escapes
from the hive not only by convection currents but by conduction and
radiation as well. In an extensive series of experiments performed
by the writers it was found that in hives packed at the top and
sides most of the heat escapes through the bottom boards; in fact,
this was so noticeable that the packing at the top and sides never
served its full purpose so long as heat was escaping rapidly at the
bottoms. It may be stated, therefore, that so long as the bottoms
are unprotected there is little insulating value in materials piled on
the top and sides beyond about 2 inches. This amount is insufficient
for most parts of the United States, therefore bottom packing should
be considered as absolutely essential wherever bees are packed.</p>

<p>To get the value of bottom packing it is absolutely essential that
the entrance be reduced, but it need not be closed. In a long series
of temperature readings on hives packed for several winters, the
authors were able to keep a temperature of 50 F. on the bottom
boards of packed hives directly behind the entrance openings. Those
who have condemned bottom packing have labored under the mistaken
notion that it is impossible to prevent currents of cold air
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"> 8 </a></span>
through the entrance. This is entirely possible if the entrances are
adequately reduced. The conclusion to be drawn from the experiments
performed is that unless the bottoms of hives are well packed,
the beekeeper ought not to imagine that he has packed his hives at
all well.</p>

provision is made for room for a third hive body to be added in the spring.</div>
</div>


<h3>THE PACKING CASE.</h3>

<p>There is no virtue in any special type of case, but in all types
there are a few points which must be observed. There must be
provision for abundant packing on the top, bottom, and sides, the
entrances must be small, the case must be rain-proof, and the construction
of the case should be such that it may be taken apart and
put together easily. The parts of various cases used in one series of
apiaries should be interchangeable. The authors have refrained in
the past from giving explicit directions for making a winter packing
case for fear that some beekeepers might think that there may
be peculiar virtue in the case used and recommended by the department
(<a href="#fig_2">fig. 2</a>). So many beekeepers, however, have written for exact
dimensions for making the case used in the apiary of the Bureau of
Entomology that it is considered best to give these in this bulletin.</p>

<p>In order that protection adequate for bees in a climate such as
that of Washington may be provided, 4 inches of packing below the
bottom board, 6 inches on all sides, and at least 8 inches on top are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"> 9 </a></span>
desired. There is advantage in packing several colonies together,
in order that they may warm each other and to reduce the cost of
the case and the labor of putting it on. The bureau, therefore, has
adopted the four-colony type of case which has been much used for
years in all parts of the country. In this case, two colonies face east
and two west. Provision is made for wintering all colonies in two
full-depth hive bodies.</p>

<p>In the following dimensions it is assumed that <sup>13</sup>/<sub>16</sub>-inch tongued-and-grooved
lumber is used, that the 10-frame Langstroth hive is
in use, and that two hive bodies are employed for each colony, with
adequate space above the hive so that, if needed, a third hive body
may be put on before time for the removal of the packing. In this
packing case the sides overlap the ends. For hives of other sizes
the lumber must be cut so as to provide the packing specified in
Table I (<a href="#Page_15">p. 15</a>). For zones F and G (<a href="#fig_5">fig. 5</a>) provision should be
made for additional packing by increasing the length of all parts 4
inches, and for zone C a correspondingly smaller case may be made.</p>

<table summary="sizes">

</table>

<p>If 6-inch boards (laying 5<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches) are used, it is desirable to use
7 boards for the height of the case; if 8-inch boards (laying 7<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
inches) are used, 5 will be sufficient. In <a href="#fig_2">figure 2</a> only 6 boards, laying
5<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches, are shown, but in this case no allowance is made for a
third hive body in the spring. For the telescoping part of the cover,
4-inch boards are used.</p>

<p>As was pointed out earlier, the hives should rest throughout the
summer on the floor of the winter case (<a href="#fig_1">fig. 1</a>). The plan of putting
them in groups of four, two facing east and two west, has much to
commend it during the entire year. The bottom therefore should be
made strong enough to stand the weight of four colonies without getting
out of shape. Since this weight may be over 1,000 pounds in a
good year, it is advised that the cleats on the bottom of the case be
of 2 by 4 inch material. The supports of the bottom and the position
of the cleats should be arranged so that the weight will not rest too
largely on the boards, and the stones or bricks used should be directly
under the center of the hives when they are in their summer position.
Obviously the hives will be moved to the outer corners of the bottom
during the summer to facilitate handling.</p>

<p>The sides of the case should be so constructed that the cleats which
hold the boards together will serve to support the overlapping sides
on the bottom. This is clearly shown in <a href="#fig_2">figure 2</a>. There
should also be a central cleat on the sides to prevent warping,
for the cases must be rain-proof. If cleats are properly placed as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"> 10 </a></span>
shown in the illustration, they make the equivalent of a halved joint
at the corners. The sides may be held in place and together by nails
or by any sort of special hook. The entrances for the colonies during
winter should be in the ends of the case, as shown. These will be
discussed later.</p>

<p>The top of the case may be made to telescope over the sides, as
shown in <a href="#fig_2">figure 2</a>, or it may be made in any other way desired so that
it is adequate to keep the packing absolutely dry throughout the
winter. The telescope cover has much to commend it, especially in
the case with which the covers may be stored in summer. The top
of the wooden cover should be covered with a roofing paper of first
quality in order that the protection will last for years. If the telescope
type of cover is used, no cleats other than the sides and ends of
the telescoping portion will be needed.</p>

Bureau of Entomology apiary.</div>
</div>

<p>A tunnel (<a href="#fig_2">fig. 2, a</a>) is also needed through which the bees may
pass on warm days and to permit ventilation. This is best made of
two boards, one the width of the packing (e. g., 6 inches) and the
other this width loss the extension of the bottom board. In most
cases this extension is 2 inches, so the lower board will be 4 inches
wide. These are held apart by strips three-eighths of an inch thick.
This is the height of the usual hive entrance in winter, and the passage
between the boards is therefore the same height as the hive entrance.
In order that the tunnel may not get out of alignment, these
strips are continued back, as shown in the figure, and these projections
extend into the hive entrances at the corners. The arrangement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"> 11 </a></span>
for keeping alignment at the outer edge is discussed under "The entrance"
(<a href="#Page_13">p. 13</a>).</p>

<h3>SINGLE OR DOUBLE CASES.</h3>

<p>For those having only a few colonies, it is not always convenient
to build cases for colonies in groups of four. It is not necessary to
give dimensions in detail for those having a few colonies, however,
for they will usually wish to use whatever they have at hand. It is
often possible to arrange a heavy wooden box, such as those used for
shipping dry goods (<a href="#fig_4">fig. 4</a>), so as to make a winter case for one colony
which will answer every purpose. It is, of course, necessary that the
salient feature of a good winter case be preserved. If the arrangement
of the apiary makes it inconvenient to have the colonies in
groups of four throughout the year, it is quite possible to make good
cases for two colonies. Anything other than the four-colony case,
however, will probably cost more per colony, or if too many colonies
are put into larger cases there may be trouble from other causes, as
from drifting.</p>

<h3>CAPACITY OF THE WINTER HIVE.</h3>

<p>As has been pointed out, bees need room for breeding in the fall and
again in the spring. During the winter season there is no brood-rearing
in normal colonies which are adequately protected, and room
for breeding therefore is not essential during the winter. If the bees
are to have room for the proper development of colony strength,
however, they should have two hive bodies each of 10-frame Langstroth
size by about the beginning of April in most parts of the
country, and earlier in the South. In order that it may be unnecessary
to open colonies during a period of such unsettled weather as
obtains at this season, it is advised that the room for breeding be provided
in the fall and left with the bees all winter. To make this a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"> 12 </a></span>
safe procedure, it is necessary to provide more packing than would
be necessary if the colony were provided with only enough room for
the cluster and winter stores during the winter. It has been found
desirable also to leave more stores with the bees than have been left
by many beekeepers, and this is additional reason for the giving of
more room during the winter.</p>

<p>It is recommended, therefore, that in all parts of the United States
colonies of full strength be wintered in two hive-bodies of 10-frame
Langstroth size. They should, of course, be provided with abundant
protection and the entrances should be reduced.</p>


<h3>SPACE ABOVE THE FRAMES.</h3>

<p>Formerly it was commonly recommended that corn cobs, or other
objects designed for the purpose, be placed above the top bars of the
frames, and then that quilts be placed over these. The purpose of
these objects, was to lift the quilts so that the bees could pass over the
tops of the frames. In former years it was advised that holes be
bored through the combs to permit passage from one space to the
other. Of late years these things have been abandoned, to a large
degree, for it is known now that if bees are packed as they should
be they may pass easily at all times to any part of the hive as need
arises. It is often stated that bees die of starvation in the hives when
there is abundant honey not many inches away from the cluster.
This, of course, never happens in colonies that are well packed. In
colonies that are adequately protected there is no better plan than
simply to leave the regular wooden cover in place and sealed down by
the bees. Quilts directly over the frames are a nuisance at any time,
and during the winter they are of no value for upward ventilation
in well packed colonies and should be used only as a poor makeshift
for good packing.</p>


<h3>UPWARD VENTILATION.</h3>

<p>A common practice has been to remove the hive cover when the
bees are packed for winter and to cover the frames with burlap or
some such porous material, the object being to allow the escape of
any moisture which may be generated within the hive during the
winter. Moisture is being generated constantly as the bees consume
the honey stores, but if the bees are adequately packed the amount
of moisture will be reduced to the minimum. The chief dancer, of
course, is from moisture which condenses, and in an adequately
packed hive there is no condensation. The temperature never goes
low enough for water vapor to condense. Therefore it is obvious that
upward ventilation for the escape of moisture is never needed in
hives that are packed as they should be. Any beekeeper who has had
trouble in the past with condensed moisture in the hives, or with wet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"> 13 </a></span>
packing over the porous tops, may be sure that he has not provided
enough packing material.</p>

<p>Another thing is to be considered in connection with the subject
of upward ventilation. The entrances to the hives must be greatly
reduced in order that there may not be excessive loss of heat at that
point. If upward ventilation is provided, there is opportunity for
the wind to blow through even the small entrance, through the hive
and out through the porous cover. This current of air will be slight
but nevertheless it exists, and serves as an avenue for the escape of
considerable heat.</p>

<p>If insufficient packing is provided, upward ventilation becomes
almost necessary, unless a large entrance is left. The beekeeper
must see to it that he is providing adequate packing material before
he gives up the upward ventilation, but he should not count his bees
well packed for winter so long as he must provide for the escape of
condensed moisture.</p>


<h3><a id="THE_ENTRANCE"></a>THE ENTRANCE.</h3>

<p>As has been pointed out, the entrances of hives must be greatly
reduced during the winter in order that the efficacy of the bottom
packing may be preserved. It is desirable, however, that provision
be made for larger entrances during the early fall and again in the
spring. To provide conditions suitable at all times while the packing
cases are on, the Bureau of Entomology has adopted a type of
entrance which to some extent has been used previously in the North.
Five <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub>-inch anger holes are bored in the ends of the packing case at
a height that will allow for the thickness of the case floor, the bottom
packing, and the thickness of the bottom of the hive. This usually
is a little over 6 inches from the lower edge of the case ends. No
alighting board should be placed at the outer entrance holes, as it is
not needed and serves only to collect snow and ice.</p>

<p>To prevent the tunnels from getting out of alignment at the outer
edge, a peg of the diameter of the holes is inserted through the outer
hole for each hive and into the tunnel (see <a href="#fig_2">fig. 2</a>). This peg is usually
about 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches long. This leaves four auger holes, each three-eighths
of an inch in diameter, for the bees to use as an entrance during the
fall and spring, and during the colder weather a piece of section
material or a small board is tacked over three of the holes. (See <a href="#fig_3">fig. 3</a>.)
This gives in winter a single hole for an entrance, three-eighths of an
inch in diameter. This provides a place for the bees to remove their
dead, a place for flight on moderately warm days, and also provides
adequate ventilation for the hive while the bees are confined without
an opportunity for flight. However, the size of entrance should not
be discussed without warning beekeepers that unless adequate packing
is provided, such a small entrance may result in the death of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"> 14 </a></span>
colony. Furthermore, a poorly packed colony will not be able to
carry out the bees as they die, and the death rate will be higher; and
these things combined may result in an accumulation of dead bees at
the entrance, which will serve to suffocate the remaining bees. A
colony that is well packed, however, is able to remove all dead bees
as fast as they die, and there will never be an accumulation on the
floor of the hive. Furthermore, a well-packed colony does not need
so large an entrance for ventilation as does one that is not packed
or which has not enough packing. If snow drifts over the small
entrance here described, the beekeeper need have no anxiety, for the
bees can still receive adequate ventilation. If a crust of ice closes
the entrance it will be well to break it, but usually the escaping heat
will melt this ice before any damage is done.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a id="WINTER_SCHEDULE"></a>WINTER SCHEDULE.</h2>

<p>Great confusion has existed among beekeepers as to the right time
to pack the bees for winter, and especially as to the right time to
remove the packing in the spring. It is quite possible to give definite
directions for both procedures and to place the recommendations
on a firm foundation by basing them on weather phenomena.
The maps (figs. <a href="#fig_5">5</a> and <a href="#fig_6">6</a>), showing the time of the first average killing
frost in the fall, serve as a basis for the recommendations for each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"> 15 </a></span>
of the zones into which the map of the eastern United States is divided.
Perhaps it will be a matter of surprise to beekeepers in parts
of the South to see that, so far as the wintering of the bees is concerned,
they are as far north as beekeepers who live many miles
farther toward the pole.</p>

<p>The lines on <a href="#fig_5">figure 5</a> indicate the average dates of the first
killing frost in the fall, and these dates, given at the ends of
the heavy lines, are of direct value to the beekeeper as giving the
proper time for putting on the winter cases. The average dates of
the last killing frost in the spring do not show exactly the same lines
on the maps, but the differences are not sufficiently great to justify
the use of a separate map for this purpose. The authors have chosen
therefore to divide the country into the zones indicated, and the recommendations
given below apply to each of the zones shown.</p>

<p>On account of the variations in elevation, it is impossible to carry
these lines into the Rocky Mountain region, but as packing is just
as necessary in the West as in the East, <a href="#fig_6">figure 6</a> is inserted to
indicate roughly the time for the putting on of the packing in the
fall. The dates in this map are the average dates of the first killing
frost. By consulting Table I the beekeeper of the West may learn
the time advised for the removal of the packing, by placing his
locality in its proper zone, on the basis of the first killing frost.</p>

<h3>TIME FOR PUTTING ON THE WINTER PACKING.</h3>

<p>Frequently great loss of colony strength is due to delay in putting
on the packing. Perhaps this is the most common source of loss in
outdoor wintering aside from that due to a failure to pack the bees
at all. Packing should not be deferred after the flowers furnishing
the last honey are killed by frost. In case the late fall flowers furnish
honey that is to be removed, then it is necessary to wait until
nectar is no longer coming in before applying the packing, but it is
indeed rare that the last honey should be taken away, and it is good
beekeeping to apply the packing even before there is any frost at
all. The determining factor is the necessity for handling the bees.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"> 16 </a></span>
If more stores must be given them or if some of the late honey is to
be removed in order that it may be replaced by better honey or by
sugar sirup, then handling of the bees after frost may be needed, but
after the last essential handling it is much the best plan to pack the bees.
In pints of the country where bees are wintered outdoors it is quite
customary to delay packing until Thanksgiving Day, but this is
too late by far except in the extreme South (zone C).</p>

<p>It is safe, therefore, for the beekeeper to use the dates shown in
figures <a href="#fig_5">5</a> and <a href="#fig_6">6</a> and the data given in Table I as a guide to the time
of packing. He may be assured that if he delays packing later than
the dates shown therein the bees will suffer by a loss of colony
strength and vitality at a season of the year when they can ill afford
to be weakened by neglect. Under no circumstances should packing
be delayed more, than two weeks after the date given for each zone.
Further, if packing is delayed until after cold weather begins, the
disturbance of the colony may induce the beginning of brood-rearing,
find this in turn may result in the death of the colony. If by chance
a colony has been left unpacked until after the bees have been confined
by cold weather for three or four weeks, the packing may do
more harm than good.</p>


<h3>TIME FOR THE REMOVAL OF PACKING.</h3>

<p>If bees are given the right amount of room, stores, and protection
early in the fall, nothing that the beekeeper can do will benefit them
until it is necessary to handle them because of preparations for
swarming or because of the incoming nectar. Of course if bees are
well packed they get so strong in the spring that if crowded they
begin preparations for swarming earlier than do colonies which have
been neglected during the winter. By following the methods here
described the season for swarm control is advanced, so that usually
it is entirely passed before the honey-flow begins.</p>

<p>In the region of Washington it has been found best not to remove
the packing until at least May 1. Further south or in warmer
regions it may be well to remove the packing earlier, but in localities
such as New York or Wisconsin (zone F) the packing should be left
in place until at least May 20, and usually until June 1. Obviously
this will be impossible unless two hive bodies are left on the bees all
winter, or unless more room is given in the early spring, before
unpacking. It has been found that if the bees are allowed to remain
in the cases until the dates named they may then be taken out ready
for whatever nectar may come. By that time they should have
12 frames of brood&mdash;far more than is found in the average colony
throughout the country oven in the midst of the honey-flow. Such
colonies are so strong that if cooler weather comes after they are
unpacked, as it sometimes does, they are not injured by it. Of
course the bees would be as well of even better off if the packing
could be left on throughout the year, but as yet no practicable way
has been devised for giving the bees enough packing during the
winter and then leaving it on throughout the summer. The commercial
double-walled hives which have been devised for this purpose
are all too scant in packing material for good results, and none of
them can be recommended.</p>

are the same as in corresponding zones in <a href="#fig_5">figure 5</a>. The dryer atmosphere of most
of the West does not diminish the need of packing. For localities where the first
frost occurs after November 25 no packing is recommended.</div>
</div>

<p>The dates given for the removal of packing in the spring follow
approximately the average dates of the last killing frost in the
spring for each locality. In case local conditions make the removal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"> 18 </a></span>
of the packing unnecessary as early as the dates indicated, it is
entirely safe to leave the packing on until some manipulation makes
it desirable to handle the combs, as this can not well be done while
the hives are heavily packed.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a id="WINTER_STORES"></a>WINTER STORES.</h2>

<p>In packing bees for winter two things require attention so far as
stores are concerned, and one is as important as the other: (1) There
must be plenty of honey in the hive to last until the spring honey-flow,
and (2) the stores which will be used by the bees during the
period of confinement in winter must be of the best quality and well
ripened.</p>

<p>It is, of course, possible to give the bees more honey or sugar sirup
after spring opens, but this means that the colonies will need to be
handled during this period, and this is not the best plan. It is commonly
said among the best beekeepers that "the best time to do
spring feeding is the fall before." The safest plan by all means is
to allow each colony to have at least 45 pounds of honey at the time
the bees are packed. They should then be allowed to keep any
honey which may come in later, and it will be adequately ripened if
the colony is well packed. This will be small in extent if they are
packed at the right time, and the bees will also have their stores
replenished by small amounts of honey which come in during the
early spring before they are unpacked. This amount of stores for
winter will seem large to many beekeepers who have been in the
habit of leaving loss, but the object of the plans herein set forth is
to have much stronger colonies than are found in the average apiary
in the spring, and the amount of stores mentioned may be needed.
The only places where beekeepers might have some reason to reduce
the amount of stores are locations where the honey granulates
quickly, in which event it can not be extracted later. Such honey,
however, usually is as good for winter stores as if it were not granulated,
and it may then be saved for stores the following winter.
Forty-five pounds of honey on the hive is a better investment for the
beekeeper than money in the bank, and more beekeepers make mistakes
in this regard than anywhere else in the work of the year.
Honey that is high in gums, as many of the honeys which come
from various trees, is not good for winter stores. Honeydew honey
is still less desirable. When either is present it is best to remove
it and either to give frames of good honey to take its place or to
feed about 10 pounds of good honey or sirup made of granulated
sugar after all brood-rearing has ceased. Honey or sugar sirup which
is fed late is stored in the place where the last brood emerged; it is
therefore the first of the stores that the bees use. As long as they are
having good honey or sugar stores for winter use the condition known
as dysentery will be warded off. Then, later, when they have used up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"> 19 </a></span>
the good stores, the weather will permit frequent flights, and then the
less satisfactory stores will do no harm. Honeydew honeys usually
may be detected by their bad taste, accompanied ordinarily by a dark,
muddy appearance. In case of doubt as to the stores it is always safe
to give good honey or sugar sirup. Unfortunately it is true that
many of the fall honeys are not of the best quality for winter use,
and this, in part, accounts for the heavy losses of bees occurring
regularly in some parts of the country.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a id="ALL_THE_FACTORS_OF_GOOD_WINTERING"></a>ALL THE FACTORS OF GOOD WINTERING ARE NEEDED.</h2>

<p>One frequently encounters beekeepers who condemn winter packing,
stating that they have tried it without success. The writers have
met many such beekeepers, and many of them are good beekeepers
in other respects. On careful inquiry it is learned that in all cases
they have omitted some vitally important factor. The most common
fault in winter packing is to leave the entrances of the hives wide
open. This, of course, nullifies the benefit of the packing to a large
degree, and one need not be surprised that these men do not find
virtue in packing heavily. Another common fault in packing is to
omit the packing from the bottom. Snow acts as an excellent insulation,
but one can not be sure that there will be snow at just the
right times, and it is therefore necessary, to insure good wintering,
that good packing be placed on the bottoms.</p>

<p>It is also common to face the hives to the south and then leave
the fronts without packing, under the erroneous impression that
since the heat from the sun will enter more readily, the colonies
will be benefited more than they would be if they were heavily packed
in front. To combat this view it should be necessary only to point
out that the sun shines only a small fraction of the hours during
winter. Furthermore, any place through which heat may enter easily
serves also as a place through which heat escapes. In certain well-known
cases the other factors of good wintering, strong colonies and
good stores, are so well provided that the loss from this lack of protection
is not detected, yet it is certain that in any such method of
wintering there is a great loss of bee vitality, and the bees are compelled
to do more work in heat generation than would be the case
were they well packed.</p>

<p>It can not be stated too strongly that the right way to winter bees
is to provide all the factors needed, and not to omit any of them
simply because in most years the bees can get through without all
dying when less help is given. The three things necessary for successful
earing for bees from the time they are packed until they are
unpacked in the late spring are (1) plenty of protection, (2) plenty
of stores of good quality, and (3) plenty of room for the building
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"> 20 </a></span>
up of the colony strength in the spring. None of these may be
omitted without reducing the colony strength in the spring, and, as
every good beekeeper knows, it is the strong colonies which get the
maximum crop.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a id="MEASURES_OF_SUCCESS_IN_WINTERING"></a>MEASURES OF SUCCESS IN WINTERING.</h2>

<p>It is often difficult for a beekeeper to know whether he is wintering
his bees as well as he should, for he may not have been able to
learn from reading or visiting other apiaries how well colonies may
be brought through the winter. The writers therefore have attempted
to give here a few measures which the beekeeper may apply
to his apiary, that he may be able to decide whether his methods of
wintering should be improved.</p>

<p>1. When bees are adequately packed and protected from the wind,
they are able to push out the dead bees as they die in winter. There
should never be an accumulation of dead bees on the bottom board.</p>

<p>2. A colony of full strength will have 12 Langstroth frames filled
with brood by the time that the bees should be unpacked. The bees
should not be taken from their cases until it is necessary to handle
them, and if two hive bodies have been given each colony, unpacking
may be deferred until time for the control of swarming or until the
new honey is coming in freely. Sometimes it even happens that
colonies need a third hive as a swarm prevention measure before it is
time to remove the packing, in which case it can be given and the
packing replaced, at least around the sides of the third hive body.
Space for this is indicated in the dimensions given on <a href="#Page_9">page 9</a>.</p>

<p>3. A colony is not of proper strength for winter unless it has between
three and four frames of brood two months before the time
for putting on packing. Usually this will be six weeks before brood-rearing
ceases. If there is less brood at that time it indicates either
that the queen is not good or that the colony has been weakened from
some other cause. If taken in time this condition may be remedied
by adding brood or honey or by uniting. It is extravagant to attempt
to winter weak colonies.</p>

<p>4. If a thermometer is inserted into the hive through the auger
hole entrance at the time of the coldest weather in winter it should
show a temperature above the freezing point. At no time should the
temperature of any part of the hive go below freezing, and the point
just within the entrance is the most convenient one at which to take
the temperature readings. The lowest temperature obviously will
be at this point.</p>

<p class="center">[Extracts from President Wilson's message to the Farmers' Conference<br />
at Urbana, Ill., January 31, 1918.]</p>


<p>The forces that fight for freedom, the freedom of men all over
the world as well as our own, depend upon us in an extraordinary
and unexpected degree for sustenance, for the supply
of the materials by which men are to live and to fight, and it
will be our glory when the war is over that we have supplied
those materials and supplied them abundantly, and it will be
all the more glory because in supplying them we have made
our supreme effort and sacrifice.</p>

<p>In the field of agriculture we have agencies and instrumentalities,
fortunately, such as no other Government in the world
can show. The Department of Agriculture is undoubtedly the
greatest practical and scientific agricultural organization in the
world. Its total annual budget of $10,000,000 has been increased
during the last four years more than 72 per cent. It
has a staff of 18,000, including a large number of highly trained
experts, and alongside of it stand the unique land-grant colleges,
which are without example elsewhere, and the 69 State
and Federal experiment stations. These colleges and experiment
stations have a total endowment of plant and equipment
of $172,000,000 and an income or more than $35,000,000 with
10,271 teachers, a resident student body of 125,000, and a vast
additional number receiving instructions at their homes.
County agents, joint officers of the Department of Agriculture
and of the colleges, are everywhere cooperating with the farmers
and assisting them. The number of extension workers
under the Smith-Lever Act and under the recent emergency
legislation has grown to 5,500 men and women working regularly
in the various communities and taking to the farmer the
latest scientific and practical information. Alongside these
great public agencies stand the very effective voluntary organizations
among the farmers themselves which are more and
more learning the best methods of cooperation and the best
methods of putting to practical use the assistance derived from
governmental sources. The banking legislation of the last two
or three years has given the farmers access to the great lendable
capital of the country, and it has become the duly both
of the men in charge of the Federal Reserve Banking System
and of the Farm Loan Banking System to see to it that the
farmers obtain the credit, both short term and long term, to
which they are entitled not only, but which it is imperatively
necessary should be extended to them if the present tasks of
the country are to be adequately performed. Both by direct
purchase of nitrates and by the establishment of plants to produce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"> 22 </a></span>
nitrates, the Government is doing its utmost to assist in
the problem of fertilization. The Department of Agriculture
and other agencies are actively assisting the farmers to locate,
safeguard, and secure at cost an adequate supply of sound seed.</p>

<p>The farmers of this country are as efficient as any other
farmers in the world. They do not produce more per acre
than the farmers in Europe. It is not necessary that they
should do so. It would perhaps be bad economy for them to
attempt it. But they do produce by two to three or four times
more per man, per unit of labor and capital, than the farmers
of any European country. They are more alert and use more
labor-saving devices than any other farmers, in the world.
And their response to the demands of the present emergency
has been in every way remarkable. Last spring their planting
exceeded by 12,000,000 acres the largest planting of any previous
year, and the yields from the crops were record-breaking
yields. In the fall of 1917 a wheat acreage of 42,170,000 was
planted, which was 1,000,000 larger than for any preceding
year, 3,000,000 greater than the next largest, and 7,000,000
greater than the preceding five-year average.</p>

<p>But I ought to say to you that it is not only necessary that
these achievements should be repeated, but that they should
be exceeded. I know what this advice involves. It involves
not only labor but sacrifice, the painstaking application of
every hit of scientific knowledge and every tested practice that
is available. It means the utmost economy, even to the point
where the pinch comes. It means the kind of concentration
and self-sacrifice which is involved in the field of battle itself,
where the object always looms greater than the individual.
And yet the Government will help and help in every way that
it is possible.</p>

<p>It was farmers from whom came the first shots at Lexington,
that set aflame the Revolution that made America free. I hope
and believe that the farmers of America will willingly and conspicuously
stand by to win this war also. The toil, the intelligence,
the energy, the foresight, the self-sacrifice and devotion
of the farmers of America will, I believe, bring to a triumphant
conclusion this great last war for the emancipation of men from
the control of arbitrary government and the selfishness of class
legislation and control, and then, when the end has come, we
may look each other in the face and be glad that we are Americans
and have had the privilege to play such a part.</p>

<p>The next great factor to enlist for the betterment of Agriculture
and rural life in this Nation is the business man of the
town and the city. He has not always been alive to his obligations.
He has contented himself, in too many instances, with
plans to secure profit in agricultural trade, instead of sympathetically
and eagerly planning constructive assistance. This
duty, pressing in peace time, is of the most urgent and impelling
character in this crisis; and I appeal to the bankers and business
men to see that they omit no effort to familiarize themselves
with the agencies serving to aid the farmers and to promote
wise plans to secure the necessary results.</p>

<p class="tdr">D. F. Houston,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
Secretary of Agriculture.</p>

<p class="pmt2">In the interest of our national development at all times and
in the interest of war efficiency just now our agriculture must
be well maintained. It should be remembered that the agricultural
unit is a small unit. There are 6,000,000 farms in this
country, each an individual unit. It is to the interest of persons
who do not live on farms, even more than to the interest
of those who do live on farms, that production shall be kept up.
This means that all people, not farmers alone, but those who
live in cities as well as the farmers, are interested in experimental
and educational activities along agricultural lines as
conducted by the Federal Government and the States. These
efforts should be liberally supported.</p>

<p class="pmt2">In a time like this no man has a moral right, whatever his
fortune may be, to employ another man to render any service,
of mere comfort or convenience. When the finest young men
of the United States are in France digging ditches, sawing lumber,
laying rails, and playing with death, and when the finest
young women of the United States are scrubbing floors in
hospitals, it is a sin that almost approaches the unpardonable
offense against civilization for any man or women in the United
States to engage in a wasteful or unnecessary service.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T IS IMPERATIVE that the sugar crop of the United
States be increased, and every supply of supplemental
sweet should be augmented to the greatest
possible extent. Honey is one of the best of these and
its production may be increased without great effort.
The supply of nectar from which the bees make
honey is bountiful and the only limitation to honey
production is whether the price obtainable for the
honey justifies the labor of the beekeeper. There is
no question of this in wartimes.</p>

<p>The recent demand for honey for export has been
greater than ever before and the home demand has
also greatly increased. Because of the shortage of
sugar, all forms of supplemental sweets are being
utilized and none of these appeals to the tastes of the
consuming public more strongly than does honey.
This increased demand has raised the price of honey
and it is therefore a paying business to produce it to
meet this need, in addition to the fact that the beekeeper
may feel that he is materially assisting in the
food crisis of the Nation. It is to be expected that
even after the war is over this demand for honey will
not cease, for many people are eating honey now who
were not familiar with its delicious qualities, and
they will not forget how good it is.</p>

<p>In the production of honey, it is of the first importance
that the colonies of bees be kept strong, especially
that they be strong before the beginning of the
main honey-flows of the early summer. To bring
about this essential condition, the most important
step is the proper wintering of the bees, and this bulletin
has been prepared that beekeepers throughout
the country may be able to get their bees through the
winter without the great loss of colonies and reduction
in strength of those which still live which have
been so common in the past. The proper preparation
of the bees for winter now becomes not only a patriotic
duty, but it is good business.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
